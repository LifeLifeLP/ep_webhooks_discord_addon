# ep_webhooks_discord_addon
This is for Etherpad-Lite (https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite) and ep_webhooks (https://github.com/citizenos/ep_webhooks).




This is a self-running addon hat gets more data from etherpads (mysql) database to provide a better discord webhook experience. (at least thats the plan)
